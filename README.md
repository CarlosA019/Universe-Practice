# Universe-Practice
Simple Universe Game I made that connects two windows using a server.
—------------------------------------------------------structure—-----------------------------------------------------
The structure for this project is : table with the inputs ID, tries, attack(square you wish to attack) and boat( which is the square your boat will be in. All of the inputs are integers.
—------------------------------------------------functionality—--------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to create a simple version of the popular game BattleShips. It consists of a simple 2x2 graph shown on the player screen. The player must choose a number from 1-4 each corresponding to a square in the graph. 1 is the top left square, 2 corresponds to the Top right square, left bottom corresponds to 3 and 4 is the right bottom square.
The turn system is not integrated in this game but players must take turns clicking one box. When a player hits a box containing a “boat” the game will end. 
—---------------------------------------------working the universe—-----------------------------------------------
Although we have not gotten to the portion in which users can start a game from the screen, the users can run the projects from the code window and create two connected big-bangs in a universe. The user must have the BATTLE msg.rkt.file open aswell as a server running for the project to work.
